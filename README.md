		{
			?sorts=     hostName,-id         // sort by hostName, then descendingly by id 
			&filters=   userName@=RT,     // filter devices where a hostName contains the phrase "RT"
			&page=      1                                       // get the first page...
			&pageSize=  3                                      // ...which contains 3 devices
		}
